You should do tutorials 2-16 of the [official ROS tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials).

We are using ROS Indigo.
If the tutorials mention a different version (e.g., Jade or Kinetic), ignore that and mentally substitute them with Indigo.
You will need to use the course computers or install Ubuntu 14.04 and ROS Indigo on your own computer.

You may supplement the official tutorials with the following YouTube tutorials:
- [ROS tutorial #1: Introduction, Installing ROS, and running the Turtlebot simulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJB9tv4ThV4)
- [ROS tutorial #2: Publishers and subscribers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U6GDonGFHw)
- [ROS tutorial #2.1: C++ walkthrough of publisher / subscriber lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Cmdu6mkxD0)
- [ROS tutorial #2.2: Python walkthrough of publisher/subscriber lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLVyc9hOvk8&t=271s)

These tutorials require you to install software for the Turtlebot:
```
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot-gazebo
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-turtlebot-teleop
```
