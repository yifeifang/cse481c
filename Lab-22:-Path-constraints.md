You can add constraints to the path that should be generated by MoveIt.
The one that is probably of most interest is the orientation constraint.
This requires that for each point along the path, the end-effector maintains a certain orientation.
For example, if the robot is holding a glass of water or a tray, it should keep the object level.
From previous labs, it should be apparent that the robot's arm can move every which way, so adding such a constraint is absolutely necessary.

# Add an orientation constraint
`MoveItGoalBuilder` already includes a method called `add_path_orientation_constraint(orientation_constraint)`, which takes in a constraint of type `moveit_msgs/OrientationConstraint`.

However, you need to update `move_to_pose`:
- Add a new `orientation_constraint` arg with a default value of None
- If the value is not none, set the orientation constraint on the goal builder

Finally, edit `arm_obstacle_demo.py` and add an orientation constraint to pose 2:
```py
oc = OrientationConstraint()
oc.header.frame_id = 'base_link'
oc.link_name = 'wrist_roll_link'
oc.orientation.w = 1
oc.absolute_x_axis_tolerance = 6.28
oc.absolute_y_axis_tolerance = 6.28
oc.absolute_z_axis_tolerance = 0.01
oc.weight = 1.0
```

This will constrain the gripper to point straight ahead.

To see this work, you will probably need to increase the planning and execution times.
Additionally, you may want to lower the divider to make the planning task easier.
The more bells and whistles we add, the slower the motion planning takes.
